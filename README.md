This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, create an environment file for your Firebase credentials:

```bash
# Create a .env.local file with the following variables
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_EMAIL=your_admin_email_here
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Environment Variables and Security

For security reasons, Firebase credentials and other sensitive information are stored in environment variables. These variables are:

- Not committed to the Git repository
- Required for the application to function properly
- Must be set on both development and production environments

When deploying to GitHub Pages:
1. Set up your environment variables in GitHub repository secrets
2. Modify the GitHub workflow to include these secrets during the build process

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on GitHub Pages

To deploy this application to GitHub Pages:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will build the application and deploy it to the `gh-pages` branch of your repository.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
